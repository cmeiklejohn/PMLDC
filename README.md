## Programming Models and Languages for Distributed Computing

This repository is a work-in-progress curriculum on models and languages
for distributed computing.

I try to write one section a week, but I don't guarantee that because
this is a side project to my Ph.D. research.

If you use any of this content in a course or workshop, please let me
know, I'd love to know where it's being used and reference it from this
page.
